# Firebase Chat App

## Overview:

The project is a simple application where users can send messages to each other in real time. Currently, it is possible to log in to the platform using one's Google account. The Firestore database was used to write the application.

I used the following technologies to write the application:
 - React
 - Firebase
 - Universal Cookie
